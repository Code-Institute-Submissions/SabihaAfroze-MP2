# Design Choices
## Overall Inspiration:
[This blog post](https://www.mentalup.co/) inspired a number of my style choices while creating the website.
## Wireframes
I did not use any tool like Balsamiq in order to create my wireframe because I never used it before and I tried to learn but it cost me a lot of time for this reason initially I have made a structure of my website by pen and paper.
I prodcued some snapshot of that wireframe images of the idea that I drew on my paper for desktop,mobile and tablet version. 
The reason that this wireframe is vey concise is that my initial thoughts were not so broad and I have developed my thoughts after started coding and that's why my wireframe design is not very similar to my end project.

3.  [Wireframe for tab](assets/images/wireframes/Tabletversion.jpg)

I developed this project in [GitPod IDE](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/), where I would commit to Git, and then push to GitHub via using the terminal in GitPod. I deployed this [Github repository](https://github.com/SabihaAfroze/MP2) to GitHub Pages via the following process:

1.  Logged into GitHub
2.  Under the tab 'Repositories', I selected **Mp2**
3.  Subsequently I selected '**Settings**' from the menu at the top of the page
4.  I scrolled down the page top the **GitHub Pages** section
5.  On the dropdown bar under '**Source**', I selected '**main branch**'
6.  Once I selected 'master branch' the page reloaded, and the website was deployed
7.  I scrolled down the page again to find the **link** to the deployed website within a green highlighted area of the GitHub pages section, where this section also notified me that my website is deployed

The main branch was the only branch used for this website.
