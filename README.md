This website has three target audiences: Toddler (age between 4-6 years old), kid (age between 5-7 years old) and their parents.

Parents of toddler and kids have a large amount of say about what games their children are exposed to, wether they sould watch video or they can play educative games

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the website is one that is designed for children to enjoy. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

**Overall Inspiration**

[This blog post](https://www.mentalup.co/) inspired a number of my style choices while creating the website.

**Fonts**

- The primary font **Love Ya Like A Sister** was chosen because it resembles the simple letters and very child-friendly look.

**Icons**

- All icons used were chosen for their obvious meaning and purpose so that they can be understood by everyone.

**Logo**

-The logo is designed with vibrant color so the user can like it.

**Colors**

- The overall color of the website is very playful and vibrant so the user can enjoy it.

**Styling**

- Maths & Numbers game is loaded with lots of colorful pictures which will help the children to count easily.
- The memory game is styled with moving the cards and while two cards matched it will dance together so that the children can have fun.

**Backgrounds**

- The background video of index.html page has been chosen to represent the vastness of children's mind. Children's brains are vast like the universe and they have the potentiality to shine like stars 
- The memory game cards are chosen fruits and animals so that the overall educative game pusrpose can be maintained.
- The overall background color and images are very vibrant and cheerful color to catch the chidren's attention. 

**Audio files**

- The audio files added to the memory game are very suitable for maintaing the cheerful environment for kids. 


### Wireframes
I did not use any tool like Balsamiq in order to create my wireframe because I never used it before and I tried to learn but it cost me a lot of time for this reason initially I have made a structure of my website by pen and paper.
I prodcued some snapshot of that wireframe images of the idea that I drew on my paper for desktop,mobile and tablet version. 
The reason that this wireframe is vey concise is that my initial thoughts were not so broad and I have developed my thoughts after started coding and that's why my wireframe design is not very similar to my end project.
1.  [Wireframe for desktop version](assets/images/wireframes/Desktop.jpg)
2.  [Wireframe for mobile device](assets/images/wireframes/Mobile.jpg)
3.  [Wireframe for tab](assets/images/wireframes/Tabletversion.jpg)

## Deployment
I developed this project in [GitPod IDE](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/), where I would commit to Git, and then push to GitHub via using the terminal in GitPod. I deployed this [Github repository](https://github.com/SabihaAfroze/MP2) to GitHub Pages via the following process:

1.  Logged into GitHub
2.  Under the tab 'Repositories', I selected **Mp2**
3.  Subsequently I selected '**Settings**' from the menu at the top of the page
4.  I scrolled down the page top the **GitHub Pages** section
5.  On the dropdown bar under '**Source**', I selected '**main branch**'
6.  Once I selected 'master branch' the page reloaded, and the website was deployed
7.  I scrolled down the page again to find the **link** to the deployed website within a green highlighted area of the GitHub pages section, where this section also notified me that my website is deployed

The main branch was the only branch used for this website.
